# District Transfer Management System

## Project Overview
The **District Transfer Management System** is designed to streamline the process of managing employee transfers within the Divisional Secretariat of Ampara, Sri Lanka.

## Features

### For Employees:
- Submit transfer requests with required details.
- View the status of submitted transfer requests.
- Receive notifications about the progress of transfer applications.

### For Administrators:
- Manage and review transfer requests.
- Approve or reject requests with comments.
- Generate reports on transfers for analytics and record-keeping.

### For Divisional Secretariat Management:
- Centralized dashboard to oversee transfer activities.
- Monitor key statistics and trends.
- Maintain employee records securely.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap for responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- **State Management:** Redux (if required for complex state handling).
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access.
